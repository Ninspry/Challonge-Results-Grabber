# Challonge-Results-Grabber
This program will get results from the provided challonge bracket. This project is designed with the hope to make it easier to pull results from a bracket website.

The limit for number of players is currently 95. This is due to me struggling to make an algorithm for a double elimination bracket placing so I added some placings manually.

Future work for this may include working out integration for smash.gg also.
