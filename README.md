# Challonge-Results-Grabber
A simple BeautifulSoup webscraper that gets the results from a challonge bracket page. This will eventually be public.

### To do for the final product
- Have a GUI allow the user to input the website to get the results

- Error detection to stop false websites from killing the program

- Easy output to clipboard or into a file of some sort for data collection

- Clean up code so it's easy to read
